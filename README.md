# to-do-list-node

A simple to do list website, allowing a user to create tasks, mark them as complete/incomplete, and delele them. 
All tasks are persistant if the server is shut down, as they are all uploaded to a MongoDB database. 

The Frontend has been created using HTML, CSS and Javascript.
The Backend has been created using Node.js, Express and MongoDB.

The task shows the priority and when it was created.

Tasks automatically move to the completed section when completed.
